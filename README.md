# tibet-tomb-viewsheds
Replication scripts for Bowman and Ryavec (2021), a total viewshed analysis of Tibetan mountaintop tombs.
The "viewshed analysis" script was used within QGIS to calculated the total viewshed of each tomb and export the tabular data. The "tomb_analysis" R script was used to perform statistical analysis of the viewsheds to determine with they were different from the background average or not. Other code within this script creates the visualizations and tables for publication.
